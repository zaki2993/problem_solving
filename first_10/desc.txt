10 Problems :
Problem 1: Two Sum
Problem description:
 Find two indices in an array such that the numbers at those indices add up to a given target.
Rules:
Only one valid solution exists.


The same element cannot be used twice.


Steps to solve:
Create a new sorted list from the original array.


Use two numbers:


The first starts from the beginning of the list.


The second starts from the end of the list.


If the sum is greater than the target, move the second number one step left.


If the sum is smaller than the target, move the first number one step right.


When the sum equals the target, store the two numbers.


Use a loop on the original array to find the exact indices of those two numbers.


Store the indices in an array and return it.


Learned:
sorted() returns a sorted list without modifying the original list.


.copy() creates a copy of a list by value.


Take time to think about the solution; coding is the easy part.
Problem 2: Palindrome
Problem description
A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters to lowercase and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward.
 Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.
Steps to solve
Method 1:
Create a new empty list.


Iterate through the original string.


If a character is alphanumeric, add it to the new list as lowercase.


Compare the new list with its reversed version.
Method 2 (two pointers, no extra list)
Use two pointers:


i starts from the beginning of the string.


j starts from the end of the string.


While i < j:


If s[i] is not alphanumeric, move i forward.


If s[j] is not alphanumeric, move j backward.


Compare s[i] and s[j] in lowercase.


If they are different, return False.


Otherwise, move both pointers inward.


If the loop finishes, return True.



Learned
.isalnum() → checks if a character is alphanumeric.


.isalpha() → checks if a character is alphabetic only.


Slicing rule: [start : end : step].
